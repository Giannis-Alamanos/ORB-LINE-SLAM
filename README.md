# ORB-LINE-SLAM

**Authors:** Ioannis Alamanos, Georgios Thanellas, Costas Tzafestas.

ORB-LINE-SLAM is a **Visual SLAM** library for **Stereo Cameras** which is able to function either by combining point and line features or by using line features exclusively. We provide examples to run ORB-LINE-SLAM in the [EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) and in the [UMA dataset](http://mapir.isa.uma.es/mapirwebsite/index.php/mapir-downloads/291-uma-visual-inertial-dataset.html). The system is also able to operate in real-time using **ROS**.
